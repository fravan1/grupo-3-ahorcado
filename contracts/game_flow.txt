Phase 1:
1. Player 1: createGame(wordCommitment1, wordLength1)
   → Creates game with their secret word for Player 2 to guess
   → Game status: WAITING_FOR_PLAYER

2. Player 2: joinGame(gameId, wordCommitment2, wordLength2)
   → Joins game and submits their secret word for Player 1 to guess
   → Game status: ACTIVE
   → Both players now have words to guess

Player 1                          Contract                         Player 2
   |                                 |                                |
   |-- createGame(hash1, len1) ----> |                                |
   |                                 |-- GameCreated event ---------> |
   |                                 |                                |
   |                                 |<-- joinGame(hash2, len2) ------|
   |<-- GameStarted event -----------|                                |

Phase 2:
Round N:
1. Player 1: submitGuess(gameId, 'A') 
   → Guesses a letter for Player 2's word
   
2. Player 2: submitGuess(gameId, 'E')
   → Guesses a letter for Player 1's word
   
3. Player 2: submitProof(gameId, proofForPlayer1Guess, positions, isCorrect)
   → Proves whether Player 1's guess 'A' was in Player 2's word
   
4. Player 1: submitProof(gameId, proofForPlayer2Guess, positions, isCorrect)
   → Proves whether Player 2's guess 'E' was in Player 1's word
   
5. Contract updates both game states
   → Both players' revealed letters update
   → Wrong guess counters update
   → Check win conditions

Win Conditions

1: One player completes the word
2: One player reaches max wrong guesses
3: Both complete simultaneously (same round)
    Draw (or whoever had fewer wrong guesses wins)
4: Timeout:If a player doesn't submit proof within timeout??
